## Can I play offline?

Yes, the client and connector are only necessary for sending and receiving items. If you're playing a solo game, you
don't need to play online unless you want the rest of Archipelago's functionality (like hints and auto-tracking). If
you're playing a multiworld game, the client will sync your game with the server the next time you connect.
